# You Are a Runner!

_Published in[baystateparent Magazine](http://baystateparent.com)_ ![trish-and-family](/images/uploads/2009/04/trish-and-family.jpg) Have you ever thought about running to get in shape and perhaps work off some of that "baby fat?" Or maybe running appeals to you because it's more affordable than a gym membership and is just a step away from your front door? Perhaps you'd like to try running, but don't know how to start, what to wear, are worried about getting out of breath or hurting your knees. Or maybe you've tried running in the past, only to lose momentum and stop when the weather got too cold, or life got too busy. I know how you feel. I've been there. In fact, for most of my adult life, I was completely non-athletic. No sports in high school, no sports in college. In fact, even after I began running and had worked up to completing quite a few marathons, I still didn't think of myself as a "runner" or an "athlete." My self-image didn't match reality. So if you're thinking about running, my first piece of advice is to look yourself in the eye and say, "I am a runner," even before you first venture out the door. Visualize what you want to become, or else self-defeating thoughts will keep you from ever lacing up and venturing out. Ready to get started? Below you'll find five beginning running tips that will help you not only succeed in running, but also enjoy every step of the adventure. **#1. Make Time for Training** This may seem a bit obvious, but it's the main stumbling block for many beginning runners. Running takes time, and time especially for busy moms and dads is a precious commodity. Commit to running at least 20 minutes a day, 4 days a week. If the morning works best, do it then. If you are comfortable taking your baby along in a jogger, maybe late morning works for the both of you. It takes commitment, but it's a commitment that will quickly pay off. When I started running, I had three young children. I ran from 6:15 to 7 a.m., then went home and started the day. **#2. Get Good Gear** Fortunately, this is becoming easier and less expensive. I find a lot of my running clothes at Marshall's or T.J. Maxx. Running apparel these days are lightweight, made of fabrics that wick away the sweat from your body and have few seams in them to avoid chafing. Good running socks are usually made of a mix of polyester, acrylic and nylon. The shoes you wear will be your biggest - and most important - investment. I suggest you visit a local running store run by seasoned experts to find the right shoe for your unique feet and gait. Wherever you go, make sure they have a generous return policy, so that if the shoe doesn't fit, you won't be stuck with it. **#3. Don't Mind the Weather** Face it: We live in New England, not the ideal year-round weather conditions for exercising outdoors. But trust me on this: running in the rain, or even the snow, can be quite exhilarating. Most people just don't know it because they never try it. You'll need to invest in some basic foulweather gear, but you'll be so glad you did. So don't let the temps or threatening skies put a damper on your runs. Go with it. Or, invest in a treadmill and run indoors, if that works better for you. **#4. Run to Race** Working toward completing your first race can make all the difference to keep you motivated. You don't have to think about competing, just completing. And, you'll meet lots of other runners and enjoy the camaraderie and post-race festivities. Races are fun! Look online for upcoming races in your area and set a goal. A good source for local races is coolrunning.com. Start with a 5k (3.1 miles) or a 5 milerun. Then, download a training program that will get you there. I like Hal Higdon's training programs at halhigdon.com. You'll have a proven program to follow, as well as lots of other great advice for runners of all abilities. **#5. Run for More than Fitness** The hardest part of running is getting out the door. This is true for beginners as well as seasoned runners. Think about running as much more than achieving fitness, because it is. Running can clear your head. Running gives you much-needed alone time. Running opens up the world around you: you can hear the birds; smell the flowers; meet new neighbors. I've had my most inspiring ideas happen while running. Another way to get motivated is to run for a charitable cause. Your running takes on a whole, deeper level of meaning when you are training for a charity you believe in. And if you can find a running buddy, that's great too. You will share not only accountability, but lots of great conversations. Hopefully, these tips have gotten you excited about the possibility of running as a lifelong way to fitness, health, happiness and new relationships. Have any questions I haven't covered?
