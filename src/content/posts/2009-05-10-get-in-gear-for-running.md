# Get in Gear for Running

![apparel](/images/uploads/2009/05/apparel.bmp)Running is the perfect recession-proof sport. Why? Because it doesn’t require membership fees, a large investment in equipment, or very much gear. Sure, you can spend a lot of money if you want to on everything from high-end performance shoes to GPS devices. But it won’t necessarily make you a better runner. Below you’ll find a quick overview what’s most important to wear – and how to select the right gear – to ensure comfortable, efficient running: **Running Shoes** Your running shoes are the most important investment you’ll make, and the most important piece of running equipment you need. I’ve learned over the years the valuable lesson spending the time to find shoes that work with my unique running gait, the arch of my foot, my body frame, and budget. And hopefully, they are a nice color, too. These days, running shoes generally fall in three classes: stability, cushioned (or neutral) and motion control. A great online tool for finding the type of shoe for you is Road Runner Sports’ [Shoe Dog ](http://www.roadrunnersports.com), so I encourage you to check it out. An online tool is no substitute, however, for an in-person consultation with a shoe expert at a specialty running store, where a professional can watch you in motion, as well as find “wear” clues on your existing shoes that will point to your gait. Make sure the person is a runner and not just a sales clerk. It’s worth the time and effort to make sure you’ve got a good shoe. When you choose a shoe, leave lots of toe room for the forward motion of running – especially on downhills. I usually buy ½ to 1 size up from my street shoes. And, if you have extra wide feet, New Balance is the only shoe manufacturer that makes running shoes from narrow to extra-extra wide. **Socks** Socks are almost as important as shoes, because the wrong socks can cause chafing, blisters, and more. Buy socks that are made from polyester, acrylic, or CoolMax – not cotton – because they wick away sweat. Also, I personally am leery of low-cut socks, because they can slip down inside your shoe. Get mini crews instead, and you won’t have this problem. A few years ago, one of the elite male runners in the Boston Marathon fell behind in the pack due to a low-cut sock that slipped down into his shoe. It does happen. **Clothing** Women, you need to get a good sports bra that won’t chafe, and is designed to stay in place. Period. I used to skimp on this because I felt like my regular bras were just fine. They weren’t. I won’t go into the details. In terms of shorts and shirts (I’m focusing primarily on summer here,) choose clothing that is – again – made from lightweight technical fabrics that will wick away the sweat from your body and keep you feeling cool – and looking cool. You don’t need to spend a fortune, but once you switch from cotton to technical gear, you’ll never look back. When you dress, always dress on the cool side. Dress for how you’ll feel one mile from your run. Sure, you might have some goosebumps going out in 60 degrees with a singlet, but before you know it, you’ll be glad you left the long sleeves at home. Run as light as you can while feeling comfortable. **Other Stuff To Wear** To keep your face shaded, wear lightweight sunglasses and a breathable, mesh running hat. And don’t forget to apply some SPF lotion to your face and neck. You don’t need a GPS watch, but they are pretty cool. Any Timex-type watch (preferably water resistant) will do the trick for you. If you are running at night, PLEASE wear a reflective vest. I know, they look a little goofy, but not as goofy as you will look in the hospital emergency room or worse. Finally, if I’m running with a group or in a race, I always wear a bit of makeup. A little mascara, lipstick and eye shadow makes me feel put together, even if it’s all worn off after the run. After all, why not feel good _and_ look good, right? :)
