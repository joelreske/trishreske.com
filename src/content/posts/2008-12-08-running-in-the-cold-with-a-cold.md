# Running in the cold - with a cold.

![Ready to run and chill out](/images/uploads/2008/12/trish_running.jpg) 

I woke up feeling miserable this morning. I’ve been nursing a bad cold the last few days, and didn’t sleep well. After getting all the kids out the door with winter coats, hats and mittens, I looked at the outdoor thermometer. Eleven degrees. I checked [weather.com](http://weather.com/), and the "feels like" temp was minus 6 degrees, with bone-chilling winds whipping from the Northwest at 15 mph.

I decided to go running.

Call me crazy (and many people do), but I think running in the cold is the best way to get over (or if you’re lucky avoid) the common cold. I’m not sure if medical science backs me up on this. But I know it works like a charm every time.

Now let me explain, I’m a real wimp when it comes to being cold. And even wimpier when it comes to getting a cold. But if you asked me what my favorite outdoor winter sport was, I’d have to say running. Why? It’s the one sport where you really don’t get that cold, primarily because you’re moving all the time.

Here’s what to wear, what to bring, and what to you can do to run in the cold, with a cold.

**What to Wear (that people see):**

  1. Warm thermal running tights. Or you can wear lighter running pants (I have [Mizuno](http://mizuno.com/) Breath Thermo pants) with thermal underwear bottoms underneath. I find the latter combo works better, the colder the temp.
  2. Thermal zip or turtleneck top. I have a Hind zip-up, 90% polyester, 10% spandex. These things are WARM. You can run with just this, no other layers, in 20 degree weather. No kidding.
  3. Light wind jacket. Especially for windy days. I have a [Sugoi](http://www.sugoi.com/) with extra long sleeves that I can pull down over my hands.
  4. Warm socks. I use ski socks or hiking socks made of a polyester/acrylic/nylon mix. They should be at least quarter socks. The reason is for extra warmth; also if your running shoes are like mine, they have a lot of breathable mesh, so your feet can get cold fast with regular running socks.
  5. Glove liners or running gloves. You don’t have to buy the expensive ones. I buy cheap cotton, ones at [Target](http://www.target.com/), then cover my hands with my jacket.
  6. Neck warmer. I have a Sugoi that I can flip up or down over my nose and mouth. I only use it when I need to, or I start feeling claustrophobic. 
  7. Hat. Again, I just buy the cheap fleece ones from Target. But then, I’m cheap.
  8. Shoes (just in case you were wondering).



These are my suggestions, but it’s a trial and error thing. I also would recommend [Runner's World](http://www.runnersworld.com/) for cold-weather running tips. I suggest when you hit the right clothing combo for specific weather conditions, write it down, so you’ll remember it for next time. Today I was actually perfect.

**What to Bring:**

  1. Tissues. Especially if you have a cold. But I didn’t even need one.
  2. Lozenges. A Halls lozenge in the mouth works wonders.
  3. A warm water bottle. This would be for a long run, and if you carry water. It warms your hands as you run. By the time you're ready for water, it's cooled a bit, and the warmer water feels really nice going down, especially with a sore throat. Hey, why not some hot tea?



**What to Do:**

  1. Stay on tree-lined streets. Here’s why: On a windy day, the trees will buffer the wind, and you’ll feel toasty. You’ll also enjoy the birds chirping (yes, they are out there).
  2. Run a course with the wind at your side. In sailing, it’s called a “beam” reach. If it’s really cold and windy, running with the wind at your back feels great—until you have to turn around and go back. You won’t be beaming then.
  3. Wave to the cars. The drivers are feeling sorry for you. They can’t imagine that you’re actually having fun and that you are warm.
  4. Say hi to your neighbors. You know, the ones with the heavy coats huddled together at the bus stop with their kids all bundled up, holding steaming cups of coffee. They think you’re crazy too, so a nice hello will assure them you are really OK.
  5. Meditate and dedicate. Leave your iPod at home. Embrace the winter. Absorb the beauty. Dedicate the time to think, pray, remember a loved one.



Five miles after I left my house, I was back home, peeling off the layers, feeling great. I actually ran faster (maybe it’s because the air is thinner?), and my cold is hardly noticeable. A new cure for the common cold, Who knew?

The best part of the run? Just .2 miles from home I was looked up to see a white-tailed deer running right across my path, bounding into the woods behind my neighbor’s house.

It sent chills up my spine.
