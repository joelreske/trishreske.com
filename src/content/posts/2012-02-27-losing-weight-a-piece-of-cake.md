# Losing Weight: A Piece of Cake?

![Getting your breakfast "just desserts"](/images/uploads/2012/02/dsc_0081-300x219.jpg)Forget the Hollywood-hyped lemonade or cabbage soup diets – if you really want to keep the weight off, how about a slice of chocolate cake or some chocolate-dipped strawberries with your scrambled eggs? According to the recent New York Times article, "[Nutrition: Dessert at Breakfast May Help Dieters](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/health/nutrition/dessert-at-breakfast-may-help-dieters.html?_r=1)," a piece of pound cake in the morning may help keep pounds off for good. The 16-week study found that obese patients on a low carbohydrate diet that were given dessert with breakfast lost the same weight as those without dessert. However, during a 16-week follow-up, participants that continued eating dessert with breakfast lost even more weight and kept it off, compared to the no-dessert group, who gained back about 90% of the lost weight. This tantalizing finding comes on the heels of a recent sugar-bashing opinion piece, “[The Toxic Truth About Sugar](http://www.foodpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/Comment_sugar1.pdf)” that I wrote about in a [previous post](http://westborough.patch.com/blog_posts/should-sugar-be-a-controlled-substance), where researchers Robert Lustig, Laura Schmidt, and Claire Brindis contend that sugar poses serious health risks and should be treated as a controlled substance like alcohol and tobacco. Wait one sweet minute here. So… a lot of sugar can be deadly, but a little can be healthy? This is important news indeed. It could potentially change your approach to eating. I know, because it changed mine. Like many teenage girls, I went on a restrictive, calorie-counting diet at age thirteen, faithfully logging in every leaf of lettuce consumed, chasing after the elusive ten-pound weight loss that would catch the eye of a cute guy and improve my self-esteem. Of course it didn’t happen that way. What did happen was that the more I dieted the more weight I gained. My dieting turnabout happened after I read Bob Swhartz’s New York Times bestseller,  _[Diets Don’t Work](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/diets-dont-work-bob-schwartz/1021109972)_ and stopped thinking of foods as black-and-white, “good” or “bad.” At the time, I was in a corporate training program and ate three meals a day in a well-stocked cafeteria, gradually becoming well-stocked myself. Based on the book’s recommendations, I decided to indulge in cherry pie – every day for lunch – and only cherry pie. It only took a week before the pie-pigging compulsion petered out, and not long afterwards that I lost weight – and interest – in desserts that I once considered “bad” for me. So perhaps the key to health includes guilt-free indulgence in a small amount of sweet stuff? Westborough-based [health and wellness coach Rosanne Ryder](http://refreshyourhealth.net/) thinks so. “I’ve found the best approach to healthful eating is the 90/10 percent rule,” she says. “Every day, have 90% of what you eat be healthful: organic, whole, locally grown foods if possible. Then allow yourself 10% for something that makes you feel good. If you feel deprived, that can start a vicious cycle, where you feel as if you ‘blew’ it, so you may as well continue overeating.” “Food is something that you should take pleasure in,” Rosanne emphasizes. Now  _that’s_ advice I can sink my sweet tooth into.
