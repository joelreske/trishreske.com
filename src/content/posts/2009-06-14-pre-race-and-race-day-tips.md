# Pre-Race and Race Day Tips

![Ready for the big day!](/images/uploads/2009/06/baystateparent-group-run-001-300x225.jpg) _Week #8_ It’s finally upon us – the week of the Sharon Timlin 5K race! You may be feeling a number of emotions during this week, ranging from excitement to nervousness to uncertainty. New runners have a lot of questions before their first race – what should I expect? What should I wear? What should I be eating this week? How much should I run? How do I plan for the weather? What if I’m not familiar with the course? This blog post will answer these questions and more, and help to put you at ease and in the right frame of mind before next Saturday, so you can be safe, smart, and have fun! **Training** You have spent the past seven weeks intelligently training for your first 5K. Whether you have followed the training schedule to a “t,” or had to make adjustments, if you have been doing your best to run consistently these past seven weeks, you ARE ready for the race. Read carefully the next sentence and take it to heart: **There is NOTHING you can do this week to make you better prepared for Saturday’s race in terms of training – except to take it easy and rest.** This is NOT the week to “catch up” and finally run that 3-mile run that you haven’t done. It won’t make you any more prepared on Saturday, and could cause injury. So take it easy this week- please! Trust me that overtraining at this juncture won’t help – it will just harm you. There are only 2 runs scheduled this week. I would suggest resting all the other days. It will help you run a better race on race day! **Eating** I’ve had some questions about what to eat, whether you should be “carbo-loading” this week, or making any adjustments in your diet. My advice is to eat normally. Unlike marathoners, you do not need to store extra glycogen in your muscles for extended exercise time. A 5K, although a huge personal accomplishment, can be run on the fuel from a good pre-race dinner and a light breakfast. I would recommend that you avoid: spicy foods, milk products, alcohol, and too many sweets the night before the race. Basically, you want to avoid eating anything that could cause stomach distress. I would also recommend you don’t eat out the night before, because you can’t control the quality and content of the meal. On race morning, try to eat a very light breakfast (banana and piece of bread for example) by 7 am (2 hours before the race) so that your stomach is empty at the start and your muscles fueled. It’s better to run on an empty stomach than a full one. **Sleeping** It’s possible you may not sleep well the night before the race, out of pre-race jitters or excitement. Don’t worry! I ran two marathons on NO sleep – not ideal, but that was reality. The most important night for rest is two nights before the race, not the night before, so plan your Thursday night to be quiet and get some good rest if possible. If Thursday is a bomb, then you’ll be sure to sleep on Friday anyway. **What to Wear** Later in the week, I will send out an email on recommendations for clothing based on the weather forecast. In general, you want to be comfortable before the race while everyone is mulling around waiting for the start. If it’s a chilly morning and you are shivering before the race, you’re just expending energy that could be used later. So plan to bring an extra layer that you can either leave with a loved one or put in your race bag. The Sharon Timlin race uses “chip timing”. This means you will wear a timing chip (provided during number pickup) laced into your right running shoe. It’s very important to wear your chip, and return the chip at the end of the race. If you do not return the chip, you will be charged a fee. There are volunteers at the end of the race to help you remove your chip. You will also be wearing a number on your shirt. Pin the number to the front, NOT back, of the shirt. Although you will be getting a cotton T-shirt in your packet, do NOT plan to run in this shirt. The shirt you wear should be breathable, pre-washed, and comfortable. Wear the shirt later when you’re resting on your post-race laurels. **The Course** The course is described as a residential, rolling-to-flat course. You can access a map of the course [here](http://www.mapmyrun.com/run/united-states/ma/hopkinton/31994611). There is one water stop about 1 ½ miles into the race. I have not run the course before, but I read on the USATF certificate that it starts with a short uphill to Route 85, then a bit of a downhill, then some rolling hills and flats. If you want to check out the course ahead of time, just be aware that driving the course will not give you an accurate idea of the effort required. If you have been training on both flat surfaces and hills during the past eight weeks, you will be fine. **What to Expect** If you have never run a race before, you are in for a big treat! This race will have nearly 1,500 participants, lots of people cheering you on from the sidelines, race amenities such as water, food, and post-race, family-fun entertainment. Plus, they’ll be some Red Sox players on hand along with the Green Monster, perhaps even for some autographs. You may find yourself running faster at first because of all the adrenaline from the race and spectators. Just watch your breathing – if you are tiring too quickly, slow down. Remember, you want to finish strong at the end with a big smile on your face! When you are standing in the start line, ready to go, take a moment and reflect back to all you’ve accomplished to get you there. The race is really the culmination of a lot of hard work and determination on your part, so enjoy! And take to heart the following wisdom given to me by my beloved coach Rick Muhr that I now pass on to you: _”When you cross the finish line, you may never have a clearer picture of what you are made of and capable of accomplishing. It is a rare and unique realization that was more than worth the effort of the past eight weeks. Your view of the world and, more importantly, of yourself will forever be changed!”_ Now go run your own race :)
