# Why Buy Local in 2009? Easy.

![Fresh out of the oven.. yum!](/images/uploads/2009/01/blueberry_muffin.jpg) 2009 is looking soft for many small business owners. Just a weeks before Christmas, I had a chat with Bruce, the owner of [Great Brook Farms](http://www.greatbrookfarms.com/), a garden center and coffee shop in Bolton MA, as I stopped in to buy a poinsettia, wreath and my morning homemade blueberry muffin. (Now where _else_ can you make one stop for all that?) While the muffins were coming out of the oven, (no kidding) we talked about business. Bruce told me he's working harder than ever trying to stay ahead. I went back to my office, where we were finalizing the holiday gifts for our clients. We chose to go with [Green Mountain Chocolates](http://www.greenmountainchocolate.com/), first because their truffles are out of this world, and second because their business is down the street in Franklin, MA. We were amazed and impressed with the level of service we got from the owners there - they even hand-wrote each of our cards to clients! As co-owner of [Nowspeed](http://www.nowspeed.com), I understand all too well the impact a downturn can take on a small company. As we all brace ourselves, and are cautiously optimistic for the coming year, let's do our part and help our local business owners be able to survive the downturn, too. Here's my New Year's Recession Resolution: I'm buying my coffee at [Red Barn](http://www.redbarncoffee.com/) rather than Starbucks. I'm going to [Tatnuck](http://www.tatnuck.com/) for books and gifts, rather than Borders. I'm getting my car fixed at Erickson Auto Repair, not the Toyota dealer. Yes, I know that some of these are franschises, and from that perspective they are small business owners, too. But if I had to choose between the closing of another Olive Garden, [Arturos Italian Restaurant](http://www.arturosristorante.com/) or the [1790 Restaurant ](http://1790restaurant.com/index.php)... honestly? I think you can guess the answer. So next time you make a easy stop at your favorite megachain, ask yourself, "Who in my neighborhood could give me the same products - and benefit more from my business?" It's an easy question with potentially profound consequenses. Sideplug: If you live in Massachusetts and love blues with sizzle, don't miss James Montgomery and Bruce Marshall at [Great Brook Farms' ](http://www.greatbrookfarms.com/)"Blues and Barbeque" January 25th at 6 pm. I'll be there :)
