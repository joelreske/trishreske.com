I’ve met a lot of contagiously crazy, enthusiastically energetic, over-the-top inspirational people in my running circles, but I have to say that George Chmiel beats them all. George blows away any idea of self-imposed physical limits. 

“Just say no” is not a phrase in his vocabulary. His can-do mindset is mind boggling. And his compassion for growth-challenged kids is contagious.

I had the privilege of interviewing George for [baystateparent magazine](http://www.baystateparent.com) (watch for the article in June’s issue). George is a 29-year-old Boston resident (single, no kids), who started distance running a few years back out of frustration over a wrist injury. He blew through ten marathons in three years; then set his sights for an ultra.

Enter Lucy Horvath, the 3-yr-old daughter of George’s business associate and friend Mike. Luci suffers from a rare, life threatening growth disorder. After George saw first-hand what Luci and her parents went through on a daily basis dealing with this disorder, George decided he wanted to help the foundation, [MAGIC](http://www.magicfoundation.org/), that helped the Horvaths.

So he decided to run 155 miles in the Sahara desert last November and raise money for MAGIC and the families it supports. Not a 5K. Not a marathon. The Sahara race is the equivalent of six marathons in six days on sand, with desert temps of 100-plus degrees. Oh, did I mention he ran with a 20-pound backpack that held all his food and supplies?

George placed 5th overall in the race, and was the #1 American. And he raised $66,000 for MAGIC. 

If you’re not inspired yet, this'll move you: George just got back from his second ultra footrace in April 2010, [RacingThePlanet Australia](http://www.4deserts.com/beyond/australia/). He told me Australia made the Sahara race “look like child’s play.” On the first day, George had serious setbacks: unforgivable terrain, losing electrolytes, heat exhaustion, suffering a bad fall – it all added up. But where others would easily have enough reasons to pull out, George dug deep. Nothing was going to stop him from giving the seven-day-Aussie adventure - and MAGIC families - his all.

I’ll leave the riveting details and the unbelievable ending for you to read on his blog at [www.luciandgeorge.com](www.luciandgeorge.com) and in my upcoming article.

If you feel inspired, consider contributing to [MAGIC Foundation](http://www.magicfoundation.org/), to help hundreds of kids with rare growth disorders live the best life they can. You can donate [here](http://www.magicfoundation.org/), like I did. Then, go run your own race and make a difference. Deal?
