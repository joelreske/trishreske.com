# Awestruck in the Alps

![Me and Chloe](/images/uploads/2009/07/europe-london-paris-218-300x225.jpg) We woke up this morning to views of the Alps – thank God! It was absolutely incredible. The peaks were rugged and snow-covered, in and out of the clouds, and the temps were in the 50s. But no rain. So we quickly had breakfast and set out for a 5-mile ridgeline walk from Muren to the next town of Grutschalp. The hiking path was gravelly and wide, and steadily sloped downhill the whole way. It was beautiful. We took so many photos, especially since the clouds were moving quickly, hiding then exposing peak views as we blinked. The landscape was filled with alpine flowers, cows with their large clanging cowbells, and goats. The kids decided to decorate Caleb’s backpack in wildflowers, and the many hikers along the path, especially the older ones, smiled at the little flower hiker. Midway through our walk was a small hut, where a local woman sold homemade Swiss Gruere cheese, milk. We bought some cheese and devoured it. It was so good! At Grutschalp, we caught the tram down the mountain to the town of Lauterbrunnen. The tram rides are as scenic as the hikes, but a lot quicker. At the bottom, we had some coffee and doughnuts (better than Dunkin Donuts, by far) and enjoyed the view of a towering waterfall freefalling over the cliff rock with a roar. Travel in the Swiss Alps is mostly up and down, whether it’s roads, tram, or rail. We caught the tram back up to Grutschalp, then a short train ride to Muren. We realized that our quiet town at night was a group tour destination by day. Dozens of tourists were walking the narrow street, shopping, eating, or catching the tram up to a higher peak, Schilthorn. We didn’t go up higer since that peak was in the clouds, and the temperature at the top was 0 degrees. Kind of like Mount Washington, NH, except it costs $70 per person to ride the tram. The Swiss know how to make lots of Francs on the views. We opted instead for some local hikes above Muren. Dave, Chloe and Joel took a walk up a mountain trail. It was steep, but rewarding with views. They saw a beautiful meadow, and found a playground along the way. I set out later on my own, a took the Funicular (think mini cable car) to the top of Allmendhubel, a few hundred feet above Muren. From there I hiked down one of the many trails. I chose the “mountain view” trail (1 hour) and was not disappointed. All the way down to Muren, I was greeted with cows grazing, streams and spectacular views of Jungfrau and Eiger peaks. At night, before dinner we went to a sports center with an indoor pool next to our hotel. It was the first time I could really envision this town as a popular ski resort. While the hills outside bespoke of olden times, with cows and cowbells, the sports center was modern and familiar. The contrast was odd. The next morning, we took two trams back to our car, and began our journey through the Alps, heading for Cinque Terre, Italy. The roads through the Alpine mountain pass was windier then a bunched-up ball of string, weaving us up to the top with switchbacks and heart-stopping views over the edge. When we got to the very top of the road, we got out to hike to the highest point. I felt like we were on Everest. There was a small hut with a crackling fire, perfect for hot chocolate and coffee. As we left, I marveled at how rugged and beautiful the Swiss Alps were. We spent our last Francs on chocolate for the car ride to Italy and said Aufviederschen to zie Alps.
