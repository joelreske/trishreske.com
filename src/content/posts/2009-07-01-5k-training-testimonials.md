# 5K Training Testimonials

"Trish was simply amazing (and I do stress AMAZING)!!! She was full of spirit and encouragement and she kept me going week-to-week. She is one fabulous woman and as a VERY new runner, she filled me with determination to make it to the end. THANKS, TRISH! Would you be my coach for another race?!?! ;)"

"I am so proud that I was being part of this wonderful experience. I'm thankful to Trish and Bay State Parent for providing me with this opportunity to challenge myself and accomplish this 5K. I loved the group runs!!!" 

"Great to be involved in a group, since generally running is usually limited to being an individual sport. Makes it a lot more enjoyable and meaningful to be in a group! And to feel like you are training together. THANKS!"

"Running my first 5K was a wonderful experience. The program was very organized and Trish Reske's blog had amazing information about all aspects of running. The blog each week was very helpful and kept you right on schedule. I would highly recommend this program to anyone thinking about running."

"I really enjoyed the team run and personal support from Trish. It was great because 6 months ago I was nine months pregnant and now I am running 3 miles. it was a great confidence builder. Thank you!"

"Trish was a great motivator before the race and ran across the finish line with us! I appreciate her enthusiasm."

"I really enjoyed reading Trish's weekly blog. Her tips were incredibly insightful, practical & helpful! I am amazed that I was not only able to complete the 5K, but enjoyed running it & am already looking for another race soon to replicate this experience!"

"Getting back to a regular running schedule has been a personal goal of mine for a while, and preparing for the Sharon Timlin race with the BayState Parent group was a perfect way for me to do this."

"I had never run in any kind of race before, and with the training schedule and Trish's comments and emails, I totally felt like I could do it. And I did! My goal was to finish in the top 1000 (finished 999th) and in under 37 minutes (34.54). It was awesome!"
